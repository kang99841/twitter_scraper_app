# Handy Docker Commands
## Docker
docker ps               # running containers
docker images           # list images
docker volume ls        # list volumes
docker volume rm <v>    # delete volume
docker exec -it <id> bash  # enter a container shell

## Compose
docker-compose up       # starts everything
docker-compose down     # stops & removes containers
docker-compose build    # (re)build containers
docker-compose logs     # logs from all services

## Dev container
# From inside VS Code
> Rebuild Container
> Reopen in Container
> Rebuild and Reopen in Container

# Pro Tip:
Use named volumes for databases, bind mounts for code.

Don't rebuild unless needed ‚Äî it'll save you time.

Add a .devcontainer/.env to store shared secrets or configs.

Avoid storing Git config inside the container ‚Äî use your WSL2 Git setup or bind-mount it.
